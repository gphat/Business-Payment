Business::Payment - Payment Processing Library

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Business::Payment;

    my $bp = Business::Payment->new(
        processor => Business::Payment::Processor::Test::True->new
    );

    my $charge = Business::Payment::Charge->new(
        amount => 10.00 # Something Math::Currency can parse
    );

    my $result = $bp->handle($charge);
    if($result->success) {
        print "Success!\n";
    } else {
        print "Failed: ".$result->error_code.": ".$result->error_message."\n";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Business::Payment is a payment abstraction library, primarily meant to be used
in front of payment processor libraries.  The expected use is for credit cards
but care is taken to assume little and to allow the implementor to choose
what functionality is needed, leaving the door open for other payment processing
needs.
